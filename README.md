Apache2-HttpEquiv
=================

Apache2-HttpEquiv is a Perl module that provides a PerlFixupHandler for `mod_perl` 2 that turns `<meta http-equiv="Header-Name" content="Header Value">` into an actual HTTP header.  It also looks for `<meta charset="...">` and uses it to set the Content-Type.

This is a Git repository where development of Apache2-HttpEquiv takes place.  For more information, visit [Apache2-HttpEquiv on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache2-HttpEquiv/).
